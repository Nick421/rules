##  Introduction

All UNIHACK competitors must follow the following rules when participating in
any UNIHACK event.

Not all UNIHACK Mini events will use these rules as organisers can choose to use
these or make their own rules. UNIHACK Mini organisers making alterations to these
rules should create a fork and edit the rules as they see fit.

If you have a suggestion, need clarification, or have any questions about the
rules, please submit an issue here.

##  Section 1: Eligibility

1.  Teams can have up to six people; but must have a minimum number of four people.
    Teams with two or three will be asked to merge. The organisers can relax this
    restriction at their discretion.

2.  Each member of a team must be a student studying at an undergraduate, honours,
    or postgraduate course at an accredited university or TAFE college in Australia
    or New Zealand.

3.  Teams cannot have remote participants.

##  Section 2: Projects

1.  Teams have 24 hours to build a prototype. There are no restrictions on what
    form it should take, programming languages or devices.

2.  You must build the project during the allocated time and at the venue. If, for
    whatever reason, the team is unable to work at the venue, they may ask for a
    special exemption to work in an alternative venue.

3.  Any code must be published in a repository that is publicly accessible. You
    are free to use whatever code repository service you want (e.g. GitHub or
    BitBucket). You must provide this link in your submission.

4.  Teams must not work on any part of an existing project during the competition.

5.  Teams must not start on any development or design work before the competition.
    This includes, but not limited to, any code, graphics, audio, and 3D design work.

6.  Any third-party material used must be legally licensed and is available to the
    public to download or buy. You may purchase materials, tools and equipment
    for the competition, but at your own expense. You must list of all third-party
    material and APIs, including anything that was purchased, in your submission.

##  Section 3: Safety

1.  All competitors agree to follow the Code of Conduct and not act in an
    inappropriate manner.

2.  If you are asked to stop and leave the venue by the organisers, you are are
    expected to comply immediately.

3.  Failure to follow the Code of Conduct will see the organisers take any action
    that they see as appropriate. This may include calling in the police and reporting
    the behaviour.

##  Section 4: Disqualification

1.  Failure to comply with the rules may result in you and/or your team being
    disqualified from the competition. You and/or your team may also be asked to
    leave the venue.
